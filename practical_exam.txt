1. Break down for me the primary stack you’ve worked with the last 2 years.
- these past 2 years i been take over for some of our projects like information system and HRIS using PHP programming language with either codeigniter and laravel framework.
- i only handled this projects alone, so i didnt have a chance to put backend from different programming language, although i have practive myself different language like react and node js
2. What are the % of front vs backend?
- 100% both
3. What did you use for each?
- PHP
4. How to pass properties from parent to child components?
- create variables to set the values needed to 2 components with the help of useState
- make select/dropdown element that can handle the parent value to pass it in api
- if the api is return successful, set the result to a array variable and map it to the second dropdown element
5. Talk through how you would send an API request and process the response from the server
- add package axios for the api
- add package body-parser for the parsing the data
- in the FE using axios with get method i set 1 parameter which is the parent value
- now in the BE i create /api/getParams api that the FE will use to fetch what it needs
- check and get the parameter from the request api and i name it as 'id' key
- and i put it to variable which is 'par'
- put 'par' in a condition, and it depends in the parameter value which data will be return to the FE request
6.  What work/project have you done using MongoDB?
- never tried, we used mariaDB our corp
7. When should we embed one document with another in MongoDB?
